                        Hatha: concentrates on physical health and mental well-being. Hatha yoga uses bodily postures (asanas), breathing techniques(pranayama), and meditation techniques(dyana) with the goal of bringing about a sound, healthy body and a clear, peaceful mind.
                        
                        Vinyasa: translates to “flowing with breath”, is a dynamic style of Hatha yoga which joins physical postures, or asanas, with inhales and exhales, creating a steady internal rhythm for the practice.
                        
                        Power:a vinyasa- or ashtanga-style, flow yoga; power yogis move quickly between poses, but the poses often focus on building strength rather than flexibility.
                        
                        Rocket: a dynamic and fast-paced flow of yoga. The structure maintains that of Ashtanga Vinyasa, consisting of a warm up (Surya Namaskar A + B), after which one continues in the standing poses, seated poses, and ending with the traditional closing series. Another key quality of the Rocket Yoga System is the "Art of Modification." Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga method to be accessible by all practitioners, even those who may have structural disabilities who would otherwise not be able to practice traditional Ashtanga Yoga methods.
                        
                        Meditation: becoming aware of your thoughts, surroundings, sounds, smells, bodily movements, and especially your breath are fundamental techniques of meditation. The basic objective is to be present – here and now.
                    
                        *All levels are welcome to our classes.
