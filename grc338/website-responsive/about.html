        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>
            Our vision is to have a space that is welcoming and safe and that serves food that is good both for you and for our community. That is why we choose to use organic and local whenever possible. We value our local farmers and the
            amazing food they produce and have developed fruitful relationships with many over the years. Because of those relationships we are able to offer you a range of items that are built upon food grown and made right here in San
            Luis Obispo county. Our hope is that our business benefits those beyond the many who come through our doors and we believe that that is most possible when we work with and for the local community.
